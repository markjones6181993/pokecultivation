Ahoy, Rangers!\nMy name is Mr. Briney. There's been unsettling news from the seas on Route 105. The normally-calm waters have become unexpectedly turbulent, with waves crashing higher than I've ever seen them here before. No storms have been reported... It's almost as if something under the sea has been stirring. Something big.

Now, I'd investigate this myself, but I'm afraid these old bones ain't what they used to be. I'm looking for a brave and skilled Trainer who can sail with me to uncover the cause of this sudden turmoil. Whatever's out there, it needs to be handled before things get worse.

I wonder where he could have gotten by now?

Our town's Hotsprings are up ahead. Enjoy.
I have here an EGG. I'd hoped to hatch it by covering it in hot sand by the hot springs. But that doesn't seem to be enough I've heard it would be best if it were kept together with POKéMON and lcarried about. You are a TRAINER, yes? And your POKéMON radiate vitality. So, what say you? Will you take this EGG to hatch?

We draw as much hot water as we need, and yet the hot springs never run dry. Isn't it magical? These hot springs appear near active volcanoes. Veins of water under the ground are heated by magma to well up as hot springs.
